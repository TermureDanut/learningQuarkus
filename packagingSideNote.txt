types of jars : jar, legacy jar, uber-jar (speciffied by quarkus.package.type propery given as argument, default is jar)

to package a quarkus app using maven - mvn package (optional call arguments)
if you are packaging only with mvn package => in target is created a jar that contains only the code, so it can t run

in target inside the quarkus-app dir there is a quarkus-run.jar that contains code to bootstrap our app using the jars from:
        - app dir : contains all our business code as jar
        - lib dir : contains all dependencies as jars
inside the quarkus dir there is a quarkus-application.dat that speeds up the classpath scanning

to run a jar : java -jar quarkus-run.jar - starts faster, in production (%prod) profile

to create a uber-jar : mvn package "-Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar" => in target creates a name-runner.jar
uber-jar - creates a single jar containing the entire code, the dependencies and the runtime

to run name-runner.jar : java -jar name-runner.jar - starts even faster (because of the warming up) still in prod profile
