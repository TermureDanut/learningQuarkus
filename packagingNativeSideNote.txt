mvn package "-Dquarkus.package.type=native" or mvn package "-Pnative" to package the app as a native binary using GraalVM

packaging a quarkus app as a native binary is faster than all types of jars and also doesn't need it to be run using JVM (java -jar ...)
in the native binary we have the needed JVM already and the entire code

the binary can be executed only with its name and args

when using GraalVM to generate a native binary, it eliminates unneeded code or code that it doesn't understand so it can produce a binary that doesn't work
